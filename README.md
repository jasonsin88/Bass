# Dead or Alive...the choice is YOURS

## Description
We were tasked to create an online Choose Your Own Adventure game that not only gives you a sense of despair, but also the dehumanization of the game character.

When the game loads, the player was met with a text message from Lydia. Only...you don't know a Lydia, and you received the message the second you stepped foot into an abandoned house, and the door slammed shut behind you. You thought maybe Lydia can help you escape, only, every time you tried to message her, you were met with a brutal insult, resulting in distress as you tried to figure out how to escape.

Choose your actions wisely. For your soul is on the line...whether you escape the house, or you forever belong to Lydia...the choice is in your hands.
